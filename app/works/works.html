      <p>I met David while backpacking in Peru with my wife.  We volunteered for his tourism agency (using <a href="http://workaway.info" target="_blank">WorkAway</a>) in exchange for room and board while we were in Cusco.  Afterward, he hired me to develop a range of applications for his website.</p>

      <img src="img/GoogleAppsScript.jpg"></img>

      <p>The project has many facets, but it has one overarching goal: to create a total, automated system for client relations.  Elements of the system include a spreadsheet that pulls data from a MySQL database, which is populated with client reservations and contact information.  The system connects client information with a Google Calendar, automates emails and generates reports.  Plans are in the works for automated invoicing via the PayPal API.</p>

      <p>Inka Jungle Tours serves travelers from all over the world, so I've provided translation, design consulting, and troubleshooting services as needed to ensure that the whole system runs smoothly.</p>

      <p>One interesting and wonderful aspect of this project is the global nature of it.  David may be in Cusco or Poland at any given time.  I might be in Washington DC, Lima, Peru or Albuquerque, NM.  I get to speak Spanish on a daily basis.  We coordinate the whole thing using the incredible array of technology that the internet provides.  From Google Docs collaborative editing to Skype calls and remote server access, we are able to work in real time across the globe.</p>

      <p>I met Sri at the Albuquerque Creative Startups Demo Day. Her business employs refugee women, paying them a living wage to cook food from their home cultures.  She is expanding the business beyond the restaurant to include a food truck, catering service, and market stand.</p>
      <p>Sri already had an attractive WordPress site that she managed herself, and wanted to integrate two new sites under construction: Christina's Criollo (the market stand) and Global Flavors Catering.  I wrote up a report suggesting various ways she could integrate the new sites while still providing a comfortable, friendly user interface and sitemap.</p>
      <p>Afer agreeing on the steps to take, I went about implementing the requested changes.  As well as changes to the navigaton, this included modifying a child-theme with a bit of PHP and JS to provide the exact user experience detailed in the report.</p>

      <p>Chrysta Faye wanted a modern website that she could manage.  A top priority, of course, was that her new site be responsive and streamlined for mobile use.</p>   
      <p>Since Chrysta has experience managing a WordPress website, we chose the ubiquitous content management system(CMS) upon which to build the site. Another priority was a call to action for newsletter subscriptions. We decided on a two - column design, with a large header to feature artwork to complement her alchemical aesthetic. </p> 
      <p>Initial wireframing was done with ultra - high - tech pencil and graph paper.</p><img src="img/alchemyLayout1.jpg"></img><p>In my process, an eraser (and Ctrl + Z) is essential.  I also like how it presents the wireframe as a sketch that can be easily edited.</p> 
      <p>Once the design was approved, I took the twenty - sixteen starter theme and massaged it into shape. In my opinion, we might as well have the folks at WordPress.org performing security updates for us, so Chrysta's site is a child-theme of the current default WordPress theme.  It might be a bit more work than using pre-built themes more similar to our goal, but, since WordPress is the most commonly-used CMS on the web it gets targeted by all sorts of nefarious actors.</p>

      <p>Caitlin Sabo is an American fine art photographer based in Mexico City.  She wanted an elegant website to present
      her internationally recognized photography.</p>   
      <p>Caitlin, being a visual artist, had a very specific idea of what she wanted.  She wanted a black background, a minimalistic gallery, and a spacious layout.  Because her intentions were clearly conveyed, visually, we skipped the traditional wireframing step, moving on to some mockups I made in PhotoShop, which mostly played with typographic elements.</p>
      <p>Once the design was approved and built to match the mockup (starting from the skeletal Bartheleme theme), I started working on some modifications to the backend so that Caitlin would have an easy time managing her webiste.  I modified the theme's structure so that the traditional WordPress post system would instead add a new image gallery to her portfolios page.</p> 
      <p>Finally, since Caitlin is multilingual herself and exhibits in Spain, the USA, Mexico and Italy, we created both Spanish and Italian versions of the site.  This required a smarter gallery plugin.  To get the right feel, I added additional functionality to the gallery for the new languages </p>

      <p>Among many other passions, I also play music with The Missing Parts.  The best description to date for the music is "Folk Music from an Undiscovered Country", and so to express this I took a plaster casting of a friend's face and painted it to look like a map.  Photos of the sculpture are featured heavily in the site.</p>   
      <p>I chose a single-page site using JavaScript and a lot of absolute positioning.  A one-page site made sense because I wanted listeners to be able to browse while playing music in the site.  I built a custom Flash player with a skin featuring a second photo of the map/mask sculpture.</p>
      <p>I built the site from a photoshop mockup.  Every pixel had to line up for it to work.</p> 
      <p>A bit of JavaScript handles tour dates though at the moment we aren't playing shows, since the cellist lives in Alaska and the violinist is in SoCal. </p>

      <p>As well as a website, I produced album and poster art for the band.  I tend to start working with physical materials (like pen, pencil, paper) and then take images from the physical creations into the computer, where I use Photoshop and Illustrator to create a digital image.  </p>

      <p>During my last 3 semesters studying Art at the University of Arizona, I spent 18 to 20 hours a day in the university's extremely well equipped wood shop, metal shop and foundry.  The metal sculptures shown here are lost wax castings.</p>
      
      <p>I have also, more recently, developed a passion for origami.  I am currently working on a series of wood and paper lamps inspired by origami.  I highly recommend the documentary <a href="http://www.greenfusefilms.com/" target="_blank">Between the Folds</a>, which is one of those spectacular films that makes me, for one, proud to be human.</p>
      
      <p>Another of my fascinations is with fractals.  I love finding the self-similarity evident in nature, and even sometimes think I see it in human nature.  Due to the iterative nature of fractal creation, it takes a lot of time and effort to make a sculptural fractal, as the number of elements tends to increase exponentially as you iterate.  The hand fractal sculpture was one of the most time consuming pieces I've ever made.</p>

      <p>I also occasionally make some furniture, like the guitar stand shown here, which was built in my grandfather's woodshop using some of his old black walnut wood I found.  He was an architect, and the A-frame design of the guitar stand was inspired by the house he designed and lived in next to the shop.</p>

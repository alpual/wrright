      <p>Chrysta Faye wanted a modern website that she could manage.  A top priority, of course, was that her new site be responsive and streamlined for mobile use.</p>   
      <p>Since Chrysta has experience managing a WordPress website, we chose the ubiquitous content management system(CMS) upon which to build the site. Another priority was a call to action for newsletter subscriptions. We decided on a two - column design, with a large header to feature artwork to complement her alchemical aesthetic. </p> 
      <p>Initial wireframing was done with ultra - high - tech pencil and graph paper.</p><img src="img/alchemyLayout1.jpg"></img><p>In my process, an eraser (and Ctrl + Z) is essential.  I also like how it presents the wireframe as a sketch that can be easily edited.</p> 
      <p>Once the design was approved, I took the twenty - sixteen starter theme and massaged it into shape. In my opinion, we might as well have the folks at WordPress.org performing security updates for us, so Chrysta's site is a child-theme of the current default WordPress theme.  It might be a bit more work than using pre-built themes more similar to our goal, but, since WordPress is the most commonly-used CMS on the web it gets targeted by all sorts of nefarious actors.</p>

      <p>Caitlin Sabo is an American fine art photographer based in Mexico City.  She wanted an elegant website to present
      her internationally recognized photography.</p>   
      <p>Caitlin, being a visual artist, had a very specific idea of what she wanted.  She wanted a black background, a minimalistic gallery, and a spacious layout.  Because her intentions were clearly conveyed, visually, we skipped the traditional wireframing step, moving on to some mockups I made in PhotoShop, which mostly played with typographic elements.</p>
      <p>Once the design was approved and built to match the mockup (starting from the skeletal Bartheleme theme), I started working on some modifications to the backend so that Caitlin would have an easy time managing her webiste.  I modified the theme's structure so that the traditional WordPress post system would instead add a new image gallery to her portfolios page.</p> 
      <p>Finally, since Caitlin is multilingual herself and exhibits in Spain, the USA, Mexico and Italy, we created both Spanish and Italian versions of the site.  This required a smarter gallery plugin.  To get the right feel, I added additional functionality to the gallery for the new languages </p>

      <p>Among many other passions, I also play music with The Missing Parts.  The best description to date for the music is "Folk Music from an Undiscovered Country, and so I took a plaster casting of a friend's face and painted it to look like a map.  Photos of the sculpture are featured heavily in the site.</p>   
      <p>I chose a single-page site using JavaScript and a lot of absolute positioning.  A one-page site made sense because I wanted listeners to be able to browse while playing music in the site.  I built a custom Flash player with a skin featuring a second photo of the map/mask sculpture.</p>
      <p>I built the site from a photoshop mockup.  Every pixel had to line up for it to work.</p> 
      <p>A bit of JavaScript handles tour dates though at the moment we aren't playing shows. </p>

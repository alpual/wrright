      <p>Chrysta Faye wanted a modern website that she could manage.  A top priority, of course, was that her new site be responsive and streamlined for mobile use.</p>   
      <p>Since Chrysta has experience managing a WordPress website, we chose the ubiquitous content management system(CMS) upon which to build the site. Another priority was a call to action for newsletter subscriptions. We decided on a two - column design, with a large header to feature artwork to complement her alchemical aesthetic. </p> 
      <p>Initial wireframing was done with ultra - high - tech pencil and graph paper.</p><img src="img/alchemyLayout1.jpg"></img><p>In my process, an eraser (and Ctrl + Z) is essential.  I also like how it presents the wireframe as a sketch that can be easily edited.</p> 
      <p>Once the design was approved, I took the twenty - sixteen starter theme and massaged it into shape. In my opinion, we might as well have the folks at WordPress.org performing security updates for us, so Chrysta's site is a child-theme of the current default WordPress theme.  It might be a bit more work than using pre-built themes more similar to our goal, but, since WordPress is the most commonly-used CMS on the web it gets targeted by all sorts of nefarious actors.</p>

      <p class="testimonial">What an amazing job Paul did!  - Presumably what Chrysta will say when she writes me a testimonial.</p>
